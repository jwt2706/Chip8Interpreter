# CHIP-8 <s>Emulator</s> Interpreter

[![GCC build](https://github.com/jwt2706/Chip8Interpreter/actions/workflows/gcc.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jwt2706/Chip8Interpreter/actions/workflows/gcc.yml)

This project is a CHIP-8 interpreter, built with SDL2. It mimics the CHIP-8 system and includes emulation for the COSMAC VIP hexadecimal keyboard layout.

## What is CHIP-8?

[CHIP-8](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) is a programming language from the mid-1970s, designed for easy game development on 8-bit microcomputers like the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800.

## Acknowledgements

This [general high-level guide](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator) is what got me into making this. It was a lot of fun! I suggest you try it too.

## TODO

- complete the decoding support
- handle user input
- add sound
- add ability to choose rom to load
- finetune emulation speed, etc
